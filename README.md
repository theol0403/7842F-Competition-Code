This was my code for the 2018-19 VEX Turning Point season. Showcased in
https://www.vexforum.com/t/7842f-2018-19-robot-showcase-flywheel-control-odometry-engineering-journals-more/65170
. This code is the messy garbage you get when you build something while
starting from little c++ knowledge, and work your way up in terms of programming proficiency
during the season. I have made it public because it's old and not very reusable, but still might
help others learn.
This was made before I had any notion of clang-format, proper commit names, any
important information in header files (read the source files), literally any comments at
all, so it's pretty hot trash. Note: this is not lib7842.
