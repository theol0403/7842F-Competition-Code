This was my code for the 2018-19 VEX Turning Point season. 
Showcased in https://www.vexforum.com/t/7842f-2018-19-robot-showcase-flywheel-control-odometry-engineering-journals-more/65170. 
This code is the messy garbage you get when you build something while starting from little c++ knowledge, and work your way up in terms of programming proficiency
during the season. I have made it public because it's old and not very reusable, but still might help others learn.
This was made before I had any notion of proper c++ practices, memory management, clang-format, proper commit names, literally any important information in header files (better to read the source files), 
and does not have any comments at all. Therefore, it's pretty hot trash. Enjoy :p. Note: this is not lib7842.
